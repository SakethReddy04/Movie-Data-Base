## :dart: About ##
  <p>
    MDB-Movie DataBase or we can say second IMDB! based by <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank">TMDB</a> database.You can see which movie or tv show is trendy or popular and get more information from it. Or search for your favorite movie, and see what people recommend to watch next. You can even find a movies or series that an actor has played or a particular company has made. Bootstrap is used in all pages and all parts are responsive
  </p>

<br>

## :scroll: Main Page ##
  <img alt="main-page" src="https://s6.uupload.ir/files/main-page_0fay.png">
  <p>
    Its our main page.You can see two slides, popular and trend. These two lists are updated daily. You can also use search. In the search, you can search about everything like movie, tv series, tv show, companies and ... (your search history will not be recorded anywhere!).
  </p>

## :mag_right: Search Page ##
<img alt="main-page" src="https://s6.uupload.ir/files/search_d7ph.png">
<p>(some content of search is hidden.)</p>
<p>
  The search section has filters that you can see on the left side and the amount of information related to the filter is in front of it. If this number is greater than 20, pagination will be displayed. In the results section, there may be a result that does not have any information, the search is performed on everything.
</p>

## :movie_camera: Movie Page ##
<img alt="movie-page" src="https://s6.uupload.ir/files/movie-page_7oeu.png">
<p>
  My favorite pages in this project are the movie and tv show pages, because of their design. Most of the project features are on these pages. In the header section, you have access to a summary of the movie's information, such as overview, release time, category, duration, etc. In some movies, there is a collection and recommendation section. The recommendation section is created by people who have seen this movie, and the amount of similarity is also included. At the bottom of the page, you can also see pictures and... related to the movie. There is also important information on the right side and you can also access social networks.
</p>

## :film_projector: Tv Page ##
<img alt="tv-page" src="https://s6.uupload.ir/files/tv_page_jmec.png">
<p>
  As I said before, it is my favorite part. All parts of this page are the same as the movie page, except for a few parts. For example, on the TV page, you can get information about the season and the last episode.
</p>

## :newspaper: Collection Page ##
<img alt="collection-page" src="https://s6.uupload.ir/files/collection_page_zc11.png">
<p>
  The collection section is not related to all the sections, but it is related to movies or series that are the same, such as avenger or spider man (they are collections :D), in the next section, there are people who had continuous cooperation in this collection. Like actors and crew. And finally, there is the section of movies or series in the collection.
</p>

## 	:classical_building: Company Page ##
  (Sorry!. no image, to much content :))
<p>
  In this section, you can find a lot of information about film and serial production companies. You can also switch to movies or series in the header to see different content
</p>

## 	:statue_of_liberty: Keyword Page ##
  (long image? i know :( )
<p>
  This section, like the previous section, shows information about a specific word, this word may be in the name of a movie or series, part of an actor's name, the name of a company, etc.
</p>

## 	:couple: Person Page ##
<img alt="collection-page" src="https://s6.uupload.ir/files/adrien_brody_-_imdb_2_g8jp.png">
  (long image? i know :( )
<p>
  I forgot to mention another masterpiece. I worked on the resume part for almost a whole week because the api gives a completely raw information about the person. The person page is related to the information of people who work in this field. Information including biography, year of birth, person's resume, etc.
</p>
